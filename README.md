## 🚀 About the Project

**Max & Min Finder** is a small single-page application built with React and TypeScript.

The app allows users to enter a string of integers separated by spaces and instantly calculates the minimum and maximum values.  

This project demonstrates my understanding of:

- Building reusable and typed components with React
- Working with controlled inputs and state management
- Data parsing and transformation logic
- Separating business logic into utility functions
- Writing clean and maintainable TypeScript code
- Styling with CSS Modules
- Deploying a production build using GitHub Pages

The goal of this project was to practice clean architecture, type safety, and proper project structure while keeping the UI simple and user-friendly.
